the server was created in the midst of the pandemic to serve the needs of the student in the online phase, allowing themselves to connect with their friends and peers. Discord was choosen for its intuitive UI and various capabilities making moderation easier without compromising any joy in it. The server now acts as a hub for all the people, a question answer centre and a casual chatting area. We hope you enjoy your stay here and hey, thanks for joining us here!
